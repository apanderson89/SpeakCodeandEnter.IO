									<h2>My Name is Andrew</h2>
									<p>My name is Andrew Anderson, and I'm a Full Stack Engineer and a Senior Agent at Gen Digital with a passion for creating innovative and effective software solutions. With a background in management and fraud prevention, I decided to transition to software engineering and completed the Full Stack Engineering and Python courses at NuCamp. </p> 
									

										<p>My background in the comic book industry as a creator and collaborator has taught me valuable skills in storytelling, teamwork, and creativity, which I apply to my work in software engineering. I have had the highest selling comic book at Guardian Knights Comics with <a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article/Gears-Bones-comic-trade-hits-it-Kickstarter-8473510.php">Gears and Bones</a> , and have worked with high-profile writers and artists, including Chuck Dixon, James Hudnall, Ron McCain, and Sergio Cariello. </p>
										
										
										<p>I bring years of creative problem solving and unique ways to attack problems that arise. I believe in creating and stacking skill trees to raise value to myself. With a focus on both front-end and back-end development, I am skilled in React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Python.</p>
										
										<p>I am passionate about continuously learning and improving my skills. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in online coding challenges and building personal projects to expand my knowledge and understanding of the latest technologies.</p>
										
											<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my bio, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals in the industry.</p>

									<h2>What I Do</h2>
									<p>As a full-stack engineer, I possess a wide range of skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, but I tend to focus more on the latter. However, I'm always looking to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with emerging technologies. That's why I'm currently learning how to use Python for analyzing baseball statistics. You can find some of my projects on my GitHub profile, which you can access by clicking "Learn More".</p>
